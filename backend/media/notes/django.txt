As an INFP, my inner world can be a complex and contradictory place. There are times when I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders and believe that I should be more serious about life. Yet, at other moments, I find myself embracing the present and feeling like there's plenty of time to explore and enjoy life. On one hand, I feel the need to take life more seriously, but on the other hand, I am naturally inclined towards a calm and relaxed approach. This internal conflict can be difficult to navigate, and I often question whether it's a healthy part of who I am.
